# audio-signal-processing
The repo has all my plugin designs starting from the most basic
These plugins are designed on MATLAB and NOT JUCE. 
You will need the Audio ToolBox for the MATLAB plugin design 

The folder UofR has my simulations from the amplifer design course I learnt on coursera (University of Rochester 'Fundamentals of Audio and Music Engineering')
